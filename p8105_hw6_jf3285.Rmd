birthweight_clean = birthweight %>%  
  select(-parity, -pnumlbw, -pnumsga) %>%
  mutate(babysex = factor(babysex),
         frace = factor(frace),
         malform = factor(malform),
         mrace = factor(mrace)) %>% 
  mutate(babysex = fct_infreq(babysex),
         frace = fct_infreq(frace),
         malform = fct_infreq(malform),
         mrace = fct_infreq(mrace)) %>%

         mrace = recode(mrace, "1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other"))

fit0 = lm(bwt ~ ., data = birthweight_clean)
summary(fit0)

birthweight_fit = birthweight_clean %>% 
  select(babysex, bhead, blength, bwt, gaweeks, mrace, smoken, wtgain) 

fit = lm(bwt ~ babysex + gaweeks + bhead * mrace + blength * smoken + wtgain, data = birthweight_fit)

birthweight_clean %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(fit) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(fit) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + geom_point() 

model1 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight_fit)

  cv_df %>%

         rmse_model1 = map2_dbl(model1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_model2 = map2_dbl(model2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))

cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
