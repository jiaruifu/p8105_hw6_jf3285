```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```

## Problem 1
```{r}
birthweight = read.csv("data/birthweight.csv") 
birthweight_clean = birthweight %>%  
  select(-parity, -pnumlbw, -pnumsga) %>%
  mutate(babysex = factor(babysex),
         frace = factor(frace),
         malform = factor(malform),
         mrace = factor(mrace)) %>% 
  mutate(babysex = recode(babysex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female"),
         frace = recode(frace, "1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other", "9" = "Unknown"),
         malform = recode(malform, "0" = "absent", "1" = "present"),
         mrace = recode(mrace, "1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other"))
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
