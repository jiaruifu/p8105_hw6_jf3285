## Problem 1
```{r}
birthweight = read.csv("data/birthweight.csv") 
birthweight_clean = birthweight %>%  
  select(-parity, -pnumlbw, -pnumsga) %>%
  mutate(babysex = factor(babysex),
         frace = factor(frace),
         malform = factor(malform),
         mrace = factor(mrace)) %>% 
  mutate(babysex = fct_infreq(babysex),
         frace = fct_infreq(frace),
         malform = fct_infreq(malform),
         mrace = fct_infreq(mrace)) %>% 
  mutate(babysex = recode(babysex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female"),
         frace = recode(frace, "1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other", "9" = "Unknown"),
         malform = recode(malform, "0" = "absent", "1" = "present"),
         mrace = recode(mrace, "1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other"))

fit0 = lm(bwt ~ ., data = birthweight_clean)
summary(fit0)

birthweight_fit = birthweight_clean %>% 
  select(babysex, bhead, blength, bwt, gaweeks, mrace, smoken, wtgain)
fit = lm(bwt ~ babysex + gaweeks + bhead * mrace + blength * smoken + wtgain, data = birthweight_fit)
summary(fit)

birthweight_fit %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(fit) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(fit) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + geom_point() 

model1 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight_clean)
summary(model1)
model2 = lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = birthweight_clean)
summary(model2)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
